# Hi
I am a graduate student in applied mathematics at UCDavis from 2013 to 2020 (expected).

Office: **MSB3123**. Email: **(first name initial + last name full) @ ucdavis**.

My CV can be found [here](files/DmitryShemetovCV.pdf) (updated: Feb 22nd, 2019).

# Research interests
I am broadly interested in information theory and statistics with memory constraints. I am currently studying these in the context of distributed machine learning with [James Sharpnack's](https://jsharpna.github.io/) advice. My work involves a blend of theory and computation.

# Teaching
**[Fall 2019]** I am a TA for MAT12 Pre-Calculus with Korana Burke.

# Recent academic work
- **[Fall 2019]** James presented our work on scan statistics epidemiology at GeoVet 2019. I am thinking about hierarchical communication again.
- **[Summer 2019]** I am working on a project to apply scan statistics to epidemiology with Beatriz Lopez and James Sharpnack.
- **[Spring 2019]** Our paper ["Estimating Graphlet Statistics via Lifting"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08736) was accepted for a poster presentation at [KDD2019](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2019/)! Big thanks to Kiril Paramonov and James Sharpnack for the algorithm ideas.
- **[Fall - Winter 2019]** I organized the reading group ["Information Theory and Statistics"](itsrg) in the math department.
- **[July 2018]** I gave a talk on ["Statistical Limits in Hierarchical Communication"](http://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_talk.cfm?p=94861) in the Student Chapter Presentations section at the [2018 SIAM Annual Meeting](https://www.siam.org/Conferences/CM/Main/an18) in Portland, Oregon.
- **[June 2018]** I passed my qualifying exam! I defended a project proposal titled "Towards Statistical Limits in Hierarchical Communication".
- **[Summer 2017]** I worked at Los Alamos National Lab with [Marc Vuffray](https://cnls.lanl.gov/External/people/Marc_Vuffray.php) and [Andrey Lokhov](http://lptms.u-psud.fr/andrey-lokhov/) on parameter learning in models of power transmission. Our project paper was accepted for presentation at [PSCC2018](https://pscc2018.net): "Online Learning of Power Transmission Dynamics", [[Arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10021), [[IEEE]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8442720/).
- **[Summer 2016]** [Kelly Finn](https://bmccowanlab.com/lab-members/graduate-students/kelly-finn/) and I analyzed times series data of moving monkeys using various measures of complexity such as entropy rate, statistical complexity, and excess entropy.
- **[2014 - 2016]** I studied the inference of stochastic processes with memory, modeled by Hidden Markov Models, using information theory and computational mechanics. I was supervised by Jim Crutchfield.
