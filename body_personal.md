# Fun.

In my free time I like to play guitar, [metal guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUVcnsiRQ4M) in particular. George Mossessian and I hosted a local radio show [HEAVY](http://kdrt.org/program/heavy) back in 2016. If you want, you can listen to some recordings I made in high school [here](https://soundcloud.com/braveyoungtimes) or watch a video cover [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtcjUgCWa8U).

I recently read "Iron John" and "Whitman" by Robert Creeley. I love discussing books with people, so feel free to tell me about books you've read recently.

I meditate as part of the local [Bird Path Sangha](https://birdpathsangha.wordpress.com/) (we sit on Tuesdays and welcome all). This group is part of the broader [Ring of Bone](http://www.ringofbonezendo.org/) community. I've learned a lot from the writings of Shinzen Young and Daniel Ingram on meditation.

I like to mess around with coding projects.
- In the Fall of 2017, I attempted to make a [simple memory editor](https://github.com/dshemetov/simple_memory_editor) for a video game. I managed to change the memory of a toy program, but only ~20% of the time (I don't understand either). If you have insight into how vm\_read and vm\_write _actually_ work or just how memory protection works in OS's, I would love to pick your brains!
- Spring 2018, I made a [Twitter bot](https://www.twitter.com/fromthehexagons) that generates "poetry" (by senselessly mashing together poems scraped from a site). It's not very good at the moment, but I hope to incrementally improve it (next step: some basic Markov chain training).
- One evening at Los Alamos, while angry at language and the difficulties of communication, I made a [Twitter bot](https://www.twitter.com/break_words1) that misspells (almost) every word in the English language.
- While taking a year off between undergrad and grad, I fiddled with d3.js and made a [Javascript animation](https://dshemetov.github.io/voronoi-centroidal) of Lloyd's algorithm for generating a centroidal Voronoi tesselation.

# Links of interest.

Someone made Conway's Game of Life inside Conway's Game of Life: [that makes me very happy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtJ77qsLrpw). Relatedly, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF--1XdcOeM) self-expanding Factorio base is very satisfying.

I have enjoyed reading blogs such as [Ribbon Farm](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/), [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QJRo5HZp9ZdzoK7x3/beware-social-coping-strategies), and [SlateStarCodex](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/24/guided-by-the-beauty-of-our-weapons/). Those links go to particular posts that gave me a lot to think about. Politically, I steer clear of political extremism, but often think about how to coordinate action to correct large institutions without sacrificing honesty.
