# Things.

In my free time I like to play jazz and [metal guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUVcnsiRQ4M). I hosted a local radio show [HEAVY](http://kdrt.org/program/heavy) with George Mossessian in 2016. If you want, you can listen to some recordings I made in high school [here](https://soundcloud.com/braveyoungtimes) or watch a video cover [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtcjUgCWa8U).

I recently read "Iron John" by Robert Bly and Philip Morse's Autobiography. I love talking books, so feel free to tell me about something you've found interesting lately.

I meditate with the [Bird Path Sangha](https://birdpathsangha.wordpress.com/) (we sit on Tuesdays and welcome all) and the [Ring of Bone](http://www.ringofbonezendo.org/).

I sometimes mess around with code:
- I attempted to make a [simple memory editor](https://github.com/dshemetov/simple_memory_editor) for a video game. I managed to change the memory of a toy program with a ~20% success rate (yea, I don't understand either). If you have insight into how vm\_read and vm\_write _actually_ work or just how memory protection works in OS's, I would love to pick your brains! [Fall 2017]
- I made a nonsense poetry [bot](https://www.twitter.com/fromthehexagons) and a [bot](https://www.twitter.com/break_words1) that intentionally misspells (almost) every word in the English language.

# Links of interest.

Someone made Conway's Game of Life inside Conway's Game of Life: [that makes me very happy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtJ77qsLrpw). Relatedly, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF--1XdcOeM) self-expanding Factorio base is very satisfying.
