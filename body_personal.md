# Hobbies and projects.

In my free time I like to play jazz and [metal guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUVcnsiRQ4M). I hosted a local radio show [HEAVY](http://kdrt.org/program/heavy) with George Mossessian in 2016. If you want, you can listen to some recordings I made in high school [here](https://soundcloud.com/braveyoungtimes) or watch a video cover [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtcjUgCWa8U).

I recently read "Iron John" by Robert Bly and Philip Morse's Autobiography. I love talking books, so feel free to tell me about something you've found interesting lately.

I meditate with the [Bird Path Sangha](https://birdpathsangha.wordpress.com/) (we sit on Tuesdays and welcome all) and the [Ring of Bone](http://www.ringofbonezendo.org/).

I sometimes mess around with code:
- From the various bits of memory editing lore I uncovered online, I made something that resembles a prototype [simple memory editor](https://github.com/dshemetov/simple_memory_editor) for a video game, however it works only 20\% of the time (wat? agreed). If you have some insights into memory editing, I'd love to pick your brains! [Fall 2017]
- I made a nonsense poetry [bot](https://www.twitter.com/fromthehexagons) and a [bot](https://www.twitter.com/break_words1) that intentionally misspells (almost) every word in the English language.

# Internet things that make me happy.
