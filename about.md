# Hobbies and projects
In my free time I like to play guitar and make music. [Car Bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUVcnsiRQ4M) is great. If you want, you can listen to some old recordings I made in high school [here](https://soundcloud.com/braveyoungtimes) or watch a cover video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtcjUgCWa8U). In 2016, George Mossessian and I channeled our love for metal into a local radio show called [HEAVY](http://kdrt.org/program/heavy).

I like to read books sometimes. Lately, I've been slowly taking in "Iron John" by Robert Bly, Philip Morse's autobiography "In At The Beginnings", and "The Wisdom of Insecurity" by Alan Watts. I love sharing books and ideas, so feel free to tell me about something you've found interesting lately.

I meditate with the [Bird Path Sangha](https://birdpathsangha.wordpress.com/) (we sit on Tuesdays and welcome all) and the [Ring of Bone](http://www.ringofbonezendo.org/).

Sometimes I do code projects:
- From the various bits of memory editing lore I uncovered online, I wrangled together a franken-prototype [simple memory editor](https://github.com/dshemetov/simple_memory_editor) for a video game. The only issue is that it works approximately once out of every ten times you try it. Yea, it's a duct-tape-wrapped kludge. If you have insights into memory editing, I'd love to pick your brains! [Fall 2017]
- I made a nonsense poetry [bot](https://www.twitter.com/fromthehexagons) and a [bot](https://www.twitter.com/break_words1) that intentionally misspells (almost) every word in the English language. These were mostly exercises in playing with the Twitter API. It would be cool to make the poetry bot more interesting.

# Internet things that make me happy
