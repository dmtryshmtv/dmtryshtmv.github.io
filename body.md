# Professional information.

My CV can be found [here](assets/DmitryShemetovCV.pdf) (updated: Feb 22nd, 2019).

# Research interests.

I am broadly interested in distributed machine learning with memory constraints and information theory. I am studying these with [James Sharpnack's](https://jsharpna.github.io/) advice. My work involves a blend of theory and computation.

# Teaching.

[Winter 2019] I am a TA for [MAT135A Probability Theory](135A2019.html) with Shiqian Ma.

# Academic work.

[Fall - Winter 2019] I organized the reading group ["Information Theory and Statistics"](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/information-theory-and-statistics-reading-group) in the math department.

[July 2018] I gave a talk on ["Statistical Limits in Hierarchical Communication"](http://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_talk.cfm?p=94861) in the Student Chapter Presentations section at the [2018 SIAM Annual Meeting](https://www.siam.org/Conferences/CM/Main/an18) in Portland, Oregon.

[June 2018] I passed my qualifying exam! I defended a project proposal titled "Towards Statistical Limits in Hierarchical Communication".

[Summer 2017] I worked at Los Alamos National Lab with [Marc Vuffray](https://cnls.lanl.gov/External/people/Marc_Vuffray.php) and [Andrey Lokhov](http://lptms.u-psud.fr/andrey-lokhov/) on parameter learning in models of power transmission. Our project paper was presented at [PSCC2018](https://pscc2018.net): "Online Learning of Power Transmission Dynamics", [[Arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10021), [[IEEE]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8442720/).

[Summer 2016] [Kelly Finn](https://bmccowanlab.com/lab-members/graduate-students/kelly-finn/) and I analyzed times series data of moving monkeys using various measures of complexity including entropy rate, statistical complexity, and excess entropy.

[2014-2016] I explored stochastic processes with memory, modeled by Hidden Markov Models. I studied the information theoretic content of discrete-state discrete-time stochastic processes and compared methods to statistically learn such processes. I was supervised by James Crutchfield.
