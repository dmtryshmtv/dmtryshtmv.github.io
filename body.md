# Dmitry Shemetov.

Graduate student in applied mathematics at UCDavis.

Year six.

Office in MSB2127.

Email is (first name initial + last name full) @ ucdavis.

I like [metathings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtJ77qsLrpw).

# Professional information.

My CV can be found [here](assets/DmitryShemetovCV.pdf) (updated: June 2018).

# Research interests.

I am broadly interested in information theory, stochastic processes, and statistical learning with a constrained communication component. I am studying these with the advice of [James Sharpnack](https://jsharpna.github.io/). My work involves a blend of theory and computation.

# Research work.

[Summer 2017] Worked at Los Alamos on parameter learning in models of power transmission: ["Online Learning of Power Transmission Dynamics"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10021).

[Summer 2016] Analyzed times series data of moving monkeys with various measures of complexity including entropy rate, statistical complexity, and excess entropy. Joint work with Kelly Finn.

[2016] Worked on developing a distance measure between memoryful stochastic processes modeled by Hidden Markov Models. Considered from probability measures, information theoretic, and computational mechanical perspectives. Joint work with James Crutchfield.

[2014-2016] Studied various approaches to inferring stochastic processes with memory, modeled with Hidden Markov Models. Joint work with James Crutchfield.

# Fun projects.

In my free time I like to play guitar: I like metal and hosted the local radio show [HEAVY](http://kdrt.org/program/heavy) with George Mossessian.

I also read science fiction and literature: I recently read Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and Zorba the Greek.

I meditate as part of the local [Bird Path Sangha](https://birdpathsangha.wordpress.com/) (we sit on Tuesdays and welcome all): __________.

[Spring 2018] Made a [Twitter bot](https://www.twitter.com/fromthehexagons) that generates "poetry" (by senselessly mashing together poems scarped from a site).

[Summer 2017] Made a [Twitter bot](https://www.twitter.com/break_words1) that misspells (almost) every word in the English language.

[Summer 2012] Made a [Javascript animation](https://dshemetov.github.io/voronoi-centroidal) of Lloyd's algorithm for generating a centroidal Voronoi tesselation using d3.js.
