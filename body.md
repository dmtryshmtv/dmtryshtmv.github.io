# Research interests.

I am broadly interested in information theory, stochastic processes, and statistical learning with a constrained communication component. I am studying these with the advice of [James Sharpnack](https://jsharpna.github.io/). My work involves a blend of theory and computation.

# Research work.

[Summer 2017] Worked at Los Alamos on parameter learning in models of power transmission: ["Online Learning of Power Transmission Dynamics"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10021).

[Summer 2016] Analyzed times series data of moving monkeys with various measures of complexity including entropy rate, statistical complexity, and excess entropy. Joint work with Kelly Finn.

[2016] Worked on developing a distance measure between memoryful stochastic processes modeled by Hidden Markov Models. Considered from probability measures, information theoretic, and computational mechanical perspectives. Joint work with James Crutchfield.

[2014-2016] Studied various approaches to inferring stochastic processes with memory, modeled with Hidden Markov Models. Joint work with James Crutchfield.

# Fun projects.

In my free time I like to play guitar, [metal guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUVcnsiRQ4M) in particular. George Mossessian and I hosted a local radio show [HEAVY](http://kdrt.org/program/heavy) back in 2016. If you want, you can listen to some recordings I made in high school  [here](https://soundcloud.com/braveyoungtimes) or watch a video cover [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtcjUgCWa8U). Of course, I mess around with other styles, but these often days have me feeling dark and angry, so metal it is.

I recently read "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" and "Zorba the Greek". I love discussing books with people, so feel free to tell me about books you've loved recently.

I meditate as part of the local [Bird Path Sangha](https://birdpathsangha.wordpress.com/) (we sit on Tuesdays and welcome all): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__.

I like to mess around with coding projects.
- In the fall 2017, I attempted to make a [simple memory editor](https://github.com/dshemetov/simple_memory_editor) for a video game. I managed to make a toy program that changed the memory in another toy program 20% of the time. I know, wat? If you have any knowledge of how vm\_read and vm\_write work and about memory protection, I would love to pick your brains!
- In spring 2018, I made a [Twitter bot](https://www.twitter.com/fromthehexagons) that generates "poetry" (by senselessly mashing together poems scraped from a site).
- One evening at Los Alamos, I made a [Twitter bot](https://www.twitter.com/break_words1) that misspells (almost) every word in the English language.
- While taking a year off between undergrad and grad school I fiddled with d3.js and made a [Javascript animation](https://dshemetov.github.io/voronoi-centroidal) of Lloyd's algorithm for generating a centroidal Voronoi tesselation.

# Links of interest.

Someone made Conway's Game of Life inside Conway's Game of Life: [that makes me very happy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtJ77qsLrpw). Relatedly, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF--1XdcOeM) self-expanding Factorio base is very satisfying.

I have enjoyed reading blogs such as [Ribbon Farm](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/), [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QJRo5HZp9ZdzoK7x3/beware-social-coping-strategies), and [SlateStarCodex](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/24/guided-by-the-beauty-of-our-weapons/). Those links go to particular posts that gave me a lot to think about. Politically, I steer clear of political extremism, but often think about how to coordinate action to correct large institutions without sacrificing honesty.
