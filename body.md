# Professional information.

My CV can be found [here](assets/DmitryShemetovCV.pdf) (updated: June 2018).

# Research interests.

I am broadly interested in information theory, stochastic processes, and statistical learning with a constrained communication component. I am studying these with the advice of [James Sharpnack](https://jsharpna.github.io/). My work involves a blend of theory and computation.

# Research work.

[June 2018] I passed my qualifying exam! I defended a project proposal titled "Towards Statistical Limits in Hierarchical Communication".

[Summer 2017] Worked at Los Alamos on parameter learning in models of power transmission. Our project paper was accepted to [PSCC2018](www.pscc2018.net): ["Online Learning of Power Transmission Dynamics"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10021).

[Summer 2016] Analyzed times series data of moving monkeys with various measures of complexity including entropy rate, statistical complexity, and excess entropy. Joint work with Kelly Finn.

[2016] Worked on developing a distance measure between memoryful stochastic processes modeled by Hidden Markov Models. Considered from probability measures, information theoretic, and computational mechanical perspectives. Joint work with James Crutchfield.

[2014-2016] Studied various approaches to inferring stochastic processes with memory, modeled with Hidden Markov Models. Joint work with James Crutchfield.
