# Professional information.

My CV can be found <a href="assets/DmitryShemetovCV.pdf">here</a> (updated: June 2018).

# Research interests.

I am broadly interested in information theory, stochastic processes, and statistical learning with a constrained communication component. I am studying these with the advice of <a href="https://jsharpna.github.io/">James Sharpnack</a>. My work involves a blend of theory and computation.

# Research work.

[Summer 2017] Worked at Los Alamos on parameter learning in models of power transmission: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10021">"Online Learning of Power Transmission Dynamics"</a>.

[Summer 2016] Analyzed times series data of moving monkeys with various measures of complexity including entropy rate, statistical complexity, and excess entropy. Joint work with Kelly Finn.

[2016] Worked on developing a distance measure between memoryful stochastic processes modeled by Hidden Markov Models. Considered from probability measures, information theoretic, and computational mechanical perspectives. Joint work with James Crutchfield.

[2014-2016] Studied various approaches to inferring stochastic processes with memory, modeled with Hidden Markov Models. Joint work with James Crutchfield.

# Fun projects.

[Spring 2018] Made a Twitter bot that generates "poetry" (by mashing together various other poems) <a href="https://www.twitter.com/fromthehexagons">here</a>.    

[Summer 2017] Made a bot that misspells (almost) every word in the English language <a href="https://www.twitter.com/break_words1">here</a>.

[Summer 2012] Animated Lloyd's algorithm for generating a centroidal Voronoi tesselation <a href="https://dmtryshmtv.github.io/voronoi-centroidal">here</a>.
